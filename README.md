Image Classifier.

This project was made as a part of a personal archival system. It just does the image categorization part of the archival system. Basically, it could be used as a gallery app.

Here, when the reset button is pressed, all the images in the Gallery dir is shown in the TilePane. Then, if you click an already tagged image, it shows up in full screen. If it isn't tagged, the face detection algorithm works on it and extracts all the faces in it. You can either discard it or give the face a name. During the tagging, the face recognition algorithm runs in the background to show you a suggested name for the face. You can change it if it is wrong.

Filters can be added to the gallery. Add a name filter and only the pictures of that person will be displayed. Add another filter and it shows the pictures in which both of them are present.

The code does get pretty messy and unorganized at some places as I was trying to fighting against a deadline. I'll try organizing the code at some point in the future. But until then, feel free to try it out and maybe use it in some of your own projects.
